Check Virtualization Support on Ubuntu 20.04

1)	check if your CPU supports hardware virtualization via egrep command:
	  egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
2) 	Now, check if your system can use KVM acceleration by typing:
    sudo kvm-ok
    
    The output should be: KVM accerleration can be used
    If kvm-ok is giving an error then try solving by installing cpu-checker

    sudo apt-install cpu checker

Step 1: Install KVM Packages
1)	Update the repositories:                    
    sudo apt update
2)	 install essential KVM packages with the following command:
     sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils

Step 2: Authorize Users
1)	Only members of the libvirt and kvm user groups can run virtual machines. Add a user to the libvirt group by typing:
    sudo adduser ‘username’ libvirt
2)	Now do the same for the kvm group:
    sudo adduser ‘[username]’ kvm

Step 3: Verify the Installation
1)	Confirm the installation was successful by using the virsh command:
    virsh list –all
2)	use the systemctl command to check the status of libvirtd:
    sudo systemctl status libvirtd
3)	Press Q to quit the screen
4)	If the virtualization daemon is not active, activate it with the following command:
    sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
